 AI-Powered Poetry Analyzer using OpenAI Agent SDK + Gemini API 🎭📜

Proud to share my latest project that brings the beauty of poetry and the power of AI together! 🇵🇰✨

🧠 This intelligent system analyzes Urdu/English poetry and classifies it into:

Lyrical Poetry (emotional & musical)

Narrative Poetry (storytelling)

Dramatic Poetry (performance/dialogue-based)

⚙️ Built using:
🔹 OpenAI Agent SDK
🔹 Gemini API
🔹 Async Python
🔹 Modular agent architecture
🔹 Allama Iqbal's verse as the default poem 💚
✅ Includes handoffs and tracing for transparent agent collaboration.

Each agent specializes in one form of poetry, while a Triage Agent smartly routes the input to the right expert.

📌 “Iqbal is not hopeless from the barren land of his nation…” — the system proudly begins with this powerful verse.
